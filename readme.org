This project will provide useful summary information about a Planets3 empire. I will use it to learn version control using git and data manipulation and analysis using R.

* TODO
1. [ ] Use version control (git) to track changes and manage the project.
2. [ ] Use R for calculations and data output.
3. [ ] Maybe combine with Python for data input?
